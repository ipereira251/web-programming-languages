Node
non-blocking I/O operations
singlethreaded
Javascript runtime environment

On creating a new folder:
run: npm init -------------------- creates package.json :O
  type: module (more modern version)
  added 'start' line
then: npm install express

singlethreadedness -> event queue
Express event priorty: 
  timers
  pending callbacks
  idle, prepare
  poll
  check
  close callbacks
handle all timers in first queue before moving to pending queue
starvation possible, limit number of events completed before moving on
